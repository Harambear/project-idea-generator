# project-idea-generator
A static, web-application to help decide your next project.

## Introduction
Do you have trouble figuring out what to eat for dinner? 
Can't decide if movie night will be a rom-com or an action blockbuster? 
Want to start your next hobby-dev project but unable to settle on an idea?

This application is for the unsure, by a questioning (questionable?) developer.

## Functionality
This application will generate randomized project ideas from a pool of selections.
To match real-world situations, project guidelines will differ in difficulty and technical stack.
A user may select the difficulty before generating a project, or choose to tackle anything that comes their way!
